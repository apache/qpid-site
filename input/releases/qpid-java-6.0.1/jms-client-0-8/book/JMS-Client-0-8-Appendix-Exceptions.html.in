This could mean that the hostname is
              mispelt, or there is name resolution problem.</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMQConnectionFailure</td><td>Connection refused</td><td><p>Indicates that the host included in the Connection URL's <a class="link" href="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL.html#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-Brokerlist">brokerlist</a>, actively refused the connection. This could mean that the

            running.</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMQConnectionFailure</td><td>connect timed out</td><td><p>Indicates that the host included in the Connection URL's <a class="link" href="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL.html#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-Brokerlist">brokerlist</a>, could not be contacted within the <a class="link" href="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL.html#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-ConnectTimeout">connecttimeout</a>. This could mean that the host is shutdown, or a networking
              routing problem means the host is unreachable.</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMQConnectionFailure</td><td>General SSL Problem; PKIX path building failed; unable to find valid certification
            path to requested target</td><td><p>Indicates that the CA that signed the Broker's certificate is not trusted by
              the JVM of the client. If the Broker is using a private-CA (or a self signed
              certificate) check that the client has been properly configured with a truststore. See

              virtualhost. The user is recognised by the Broker and is using the correct password
              but does not have permission. This exception normally indicates that the user (or
              group) has not been permissioned within the Broker's <a class="link" href="../../java-broker/book/Java-Broker-Security-ACLs.html" target="_top">Access Control List

              of a heavily loaded broker that cannot respond or the Broker may have failed in
