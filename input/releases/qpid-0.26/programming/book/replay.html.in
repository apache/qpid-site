      that controls whether the send call is synchronous or not. A
      synchronous send call will block until the broker has confirmed
      receipt of the message. An asynchronous send call will return
      before the broker confirms receipt of the message, allowing for
      example further send calls to be made without waiting for a
      roundtrip to the broker for each message. This is desirable where
      increased throughput is important.</p><p>The sender maintains a list of sent messages whose receipt
      has yet to be confirmed by the broker. The maximum number of such
      messages that it will hold is defined by the capacity of the
      sender, which can be set by the application. If an application
      tries to send with a sender whose capacity is already fully used
      up, the send call will block waiting for capacity regardless of
      the value of the sync flag.</p><p>The sender can be queried for the available space (i.e. the
      unused capacity), and for the current count of unsettled messages
      (i.e. those held in the replay list pending confirmation by the
      server). When the unsettled count is zero, all messages on that
      sender have been successfully sent.</p><p>If the connection fails and is transparently reconnected
      (see <a class="xref" href="connection-options.html" title="2.10.&#160;Connection Options">Section&#160;2.10, &#8220;Connection Options&#8221;</a> for details on how to control
      this feature), the unsettled messages for each sender over that
      connection will be re-transmitted. This provides a transparent
      level of reliability. This feature can be controlled through the
      link's reliability as defined in the address (see
      <a class="xref" href="section-addresses.html#table-link-properties" title="Table&#160;2.3.&#160;Link Properties">Table&#160;2.3, &#8220;Link Properties&#8221;</a>). At present only
      at-least-once guarantees are offered. </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="section-addresses.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="prefetch.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="40%">2.4.&#160;Addresses&#160;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td align="right" valign="top" width="40%">&#160;2.6.&#160;Receiver Capacity (Prefetch)</td></tr></table></div></div>
