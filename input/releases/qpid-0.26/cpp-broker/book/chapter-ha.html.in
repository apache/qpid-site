      The High Availability (HA) module provides
      <em class="firstterm">active-passive</em>, <em class="firstterm">hot-standby</em>
      messaging clusters to provide fault tolerant message delivery.
    </p><p>
      In an active-passive cluster only one broker, known as the
      <em class="firstterm">primary</em>, is active and serving clients at a time. The other
      brokers are standing by as <em class="firstterm">backups</em>. Changes on the primary
      are replicated to all the backups so they are always up-to-date or "hot". Backup
      brokers reject client connection attempts, to enforce the requirement that clients
      only connect to the primary.
    </p><p>
      If the primary fails, one of the backups is promoted to take over as the new
      primary. Clients fail-over to the new primary automatically. If there are multiple
      backups, the other backups also fail-over to become backups of the new primary.
    </p><p>
      This approach relies on an external <em class="firstterm">cluster resource manager</em>
      to detect failures, choose the new primary and handle network partitions. <a class="ulink" href="https://fedorahosted.org/cluster/wiki/RGManager" target="_top">Rgmanager</a> is supported
      initially, but others may be supported in the future.

	In order to avoid message loss, the primary broker <span class="emphasis"><em>delays
	acknowledgment</em></span> of messages received from clients until the
	message has been replicated and acknowledged by all of the back-up
	brokers, or has been consumed from the primary queue.
      </p><p>
	This ensures that all acknowledged messages are safe: they have either
	been consumed or backed up to all backup brokers.  Messages that are
	consumed <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> they are replicated do not need to
	be replicated. This reduces the work load when replicating a queue with
	active consumers.
      </p><p>
	Clients keep <span class="emphasis"><em>unacknowledged</em></span> messages in a buffer
	<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.idm139836366433200" id="idm139836366433200"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>
	until they are acknowledged by the primary. If the primary fails, clients will
	fail-over to the new primary and <span class="emphasis"><em>re-send</em></span> all their
	unacknowledged messages.
	<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.idm139836367357152" id="idm139836367357152"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a>
      </p><p>
	If the primary crashes, all the <span class="emphasis"><em>acknowledged</em></span>
	messages will be available on the backup that takes over as the new
	primary. The <span class="emphasis"><em>unacknowledged</em></span> messages will be
	re-sent by the clients.  Thus no messages are lost.
      </p><p>
	Note that this means it is possible for messages to be
	<span class="emphasis"><em>duplicated</em></span>. In the event of a failure it is possible for a
	message to received by the backup that becomes the new primary
	<span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> re-sent by the client.  The application must take steps
	to identify and eliminate duplicates.
      </p><p>
	When a new primary is promoted after a fail-over it is initially in
	"recovering" mode. In this mode, it delays acknowledgment of messages
	on behalf of all the backups that were connected to the previous
	primary. This protects those messages against a failure of the new
	primary until the backups have a chance to connect and catch up.
      </p><p>
	Not all messages need to be replicated to the back-up brokers. If a
	message is consumed and acknowledged by a regular client before it has
	been replicated to a backup, then it doesn't need to be replicated.

      Some resource managers (including <span class="command"><strong>rgmanager</strong></span>) support
      <em class="firstterm">virtual IP addresses</em>. A virtual IP address is an IP
      address that can be relocated to any of the nodes in a cluster.  The
      resource manager associates this address with the primary node in the
      cluster, and relocates it to the new primary when there is a failure. This
      simplifies configuration as you can publish a single IP address rather
      than a list.
    </p><p>
      A virtual IP address can be used by clients to connect to the primary. The
      following sections will explain how to configure virtual IP addresses for
      clients or brokers.

      Broker fail-over is managed by a <em class="firstterm">cluster resource
      manager</em>.  An integration with <a class="ulink" href="https://fedorahosted.org/cluster/wiki/RGManager" target="_top">rgmanager</a> is
      provided, but it is possible to integrate with other resource managers.
    </p><p>
      The resource manager is responsible for starting the <span class="command"><strong>qpidd</strong></span> broker
      on each node in the cluster. The resource manager then <em class="firstterm">promotes</em>
      one of the brokers to be the primary. The other brokers connect to the primary as
      backups, using the URL provided in the <code class="literal">ha-brokers-url</code> configuration
      option.
    </p><p>
      Once connected, the backup brokers synchronize their state with the
      primary.  When a backup is synchronized, or "hot", it is ready to take
      over if the primary fails.  Backup brokers continually receive updates
      from the primary in order to stay synchronized.
    </p><p>
      If the primary fails, backup brokers go into fail-over mode. The resource
      manager must detect the failure and promote one of the backups to be the
      new primary.  The other backups connect to the new primary and synchronize
      their state with it.
    </p><p>
      The resource manager is also responsible for protecting the cluster from
      <em class="firstterm">split-brain</em> conditions resulting from a network partition.  A
      network partition divide a cluster into two sub-groups which cannot see each other.
      Usually a <em class="firstterm">quorum</em> voting algorithm is used that disables nodes
      in the inquorate sub-group.

      This section assumes that you are already familiar with setting up and configuring

      You must provide a <code class="literal">cluster.conf</code> file to configure

      The <code class="literal">resources</code> section defines the <span class="command"><strong>qpidd</strong></span>
      script used to start the <span class="command"><strong>qpidd</strong></span> service. It also defines the

      actually start a new service, rather it promotes the existing
      <span class="command"><strong>qpidd</strong></span> broker to primary status.
    </p><p>
      The <code class="literal">resources</code> section also defines a virtual IP
      address for clients.
    </p><p>
      To take advantage of the virtual IP addresses, <code class="filename">qpidd.conf</code>

      This configuration allows clients to connect to a single address:
      20.0.10.200.  The brokers connect to each other directly via the addresses
      listed in <span class="command"><strong>ha-brokers-url</strong></span>. Note the client and broker
      addresses are on separate sub-nets, this is recommended but not required.
    </p><p>
      The <code class="literal">service</code> section defines 3 <code class="literal">qpidd</code>
      services, one for each node. Each service is in a restricted fail-over
      domain containing just that node, and has the <code class="literal">restart</code>
      recovery policy. The effect of this is that rgmanager will run
      <span class="command"><strong>qpidd</strong></span> on each node, restarting if it fails.
    </p><p>
      There is a single <code class="literal">qpidd-primary-service</code> using the
      <span class="command"><strong>qpidd-primary</strong></span> script which is not restricted to a
      domain and has the <code class="literal">relocate</code> recovery policy. This means
      rgmanager will start <span class="command"><strong>qpidd-primary</strong></span> on one of the nodes
      when the cluster starts and will relocate it to another node if the
      original node fails. Running the <code class="literal">qpidd-primary</code> script
      does not start a new broker process, it promotes the existing broker to
      become the primary.

      By default, queues and exchanges are not replicated automatically. You can change
      the default behavior by setting the <code class="literal">ha-replicate</code> configuration
      option. It has one of the following values:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
	    <em class="firstterm">all</em>: Replicate everything automatically: queues,
	    exchanges, bindings and messages.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    <em class="firstterm">configuration</em>: Replicate the existence of queues,
	    exchange and bindings but don't replicate messages.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    <em class="firstterm">none</em>: Don't replicate anything, this is the default.
	  </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      You can over-ride the default for a particular queue or exchange by passing the
      argument <code class="literal">qpid.replicate</code> when creating the queue or exchange. It
      takes the same values as <code class="literal">ha-replicate</code>
    </p><p>
      Bindings are automatically replicated if the queue and exchange being bound both
      have replication <code class="literal">all</code> or <code class="literal">configuration</code>, they
      are not replicated otherwise.
    </p><p>
      You can create replicated queues and exchanges with the
      <span class="command"><strong>qpid-config</strong></span> management tool like this:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      qpid-config add queue myqueue --replicate all
    </pre><p>
      To create replicated queues and exchanges via the client API, add a
      <code class="literal">node</code> entry to the address like this:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      "myqueue;{create:always,node:{x-declare:{arguments:{'qpid.replicate':all}}}}"
    </pre><p>
      There are some built-in exchanges created automatically by the broker, these
      exchanges are never replicated. The built-in exchanges are the default (nameless)
      exchange, the AMQP standard exchanges (<code class="literal">amq.direct, amq.topic, amq.fanout</code> and
      <code class="literal">amq.match</code>) and the management exchanges (<code class="literal">qpid.management, qmf.default.direct</code> and
      <code class="literal">qmf.default.topic</code>)
    </p><p>
      Note that if you bind a replicated queue to one of these exchanges, the
      binding will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be replicated, so the queue will not
      have the binding after a fail-over.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ha-failover"></a>1.12.8.&#160;Client Connection and Fail-over</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Clients can only connect to the primary broker. Backup brokers reject any
      connection attempt by a client. Clients rejected by a backup broker will
      automatically fail-over until they connect to the primary. if
      <code class="literal">ha-public-url</code> contains multiple addresses, the client
      will them all in rotation. If it is a virtual IP address the clients will
      retry on the same address until it is reconnected.
    </p><p>
      Clients are configured with the URL for the cluster (details below for
      each type of client). There are two possibilities
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
	    The URL contains multiple addresses, one for each broker in the cluster.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    The URL contains a single <em class="firstterm">virtual IP address</em>
	    that is assigned to the primary broker by the resource manager.
	    This is the recommended configuration.
	  </p></li></ul></div><p>
      In the first case, clients will repeatedly re-try each address in the URL
      until they successfully connect to the primary. In the second case the
      resource manager will assign the virtual IP address to the primary broker,
      so clients only need to re-try on a single address.
    </p><p>
      When the primary broker fails, clients re-try all known cluster addresses
      until they connect to the new primary.  The client re-sends any messages
      that were previously sent but not acknowledged by the broker at the time
      of the failure.  Similarly messages that have been sent by the broker, but
      not acknowledged by the client, are re-queued.
    </p><p>
      TCP can be slow to detect connection failures. A client can configure a
      connection to use a <em class="firstterm">heartbeat</em> to detect connection
      failure, and can specify a time interval for the heartbeat. If heartbeats
      are in use, failures will be detected no later than twice the heartbeat
      interval. The following sections explain how to enable heartbeat in each
      client.
    </p><p>
      Note: the following sections explain how to configure clients with
      multiple dresses, but if you are using a virtual IP address you only need
      to configure that one address for clients, you don't need to list all the
      addresses.
    </p><p>
      Suppose your cluster has 3 nodes: <code class="literal">node1</code>,
      <code class="literal">node2</code> and <code class="literal">node3</code> all using the
      default AMQP port, and you are not using a virtual IP address. To connect
      a client you need to specify the address(es) and set the
      <code class="literal">reconnect</code> property to <code class="literal">true</code>. The
      following sub-sections show how to connect each type of client.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ha-clients"></a>1.12.8.1.&#160;C++ clients</h4></div></div></div><p>
	With the C++ client, you specify multiple cluster addresses in a single URL
	<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.idm139836370894704" id="idm139836370894704"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a>
	You also need to specify the connection option
	<code class="literal">reconnect</code> to be true.  For example:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	qpid::messaging::Connection c("node1,node2,node3","{reconnect:true}");
      </pre><p>
	Heartbeats are disabled by default. You can enable them by specifying a
	heartbeat interval (in seconds) for the connection via the
	<code class="literal">heartbeat</code> option. For example:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
	  qpid::messaging::Connection c("node1,node2,node3","{reconnect:true,heartbeat:10}");

	connection via the 'heartbeat' option. For example:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

	In Java JMS clients, client fail-over is handled automatically if it is
	enabled in the connection.  You can configure a connection to use
	fail-over using the <span class="command"><strong>failover</strong></span> property:
      </p><pre class="screen">
	connectionfactory.qpidConnectionfactory = amqp://guest:guest@clientid/test?brokerlist='tcp://localhost:5672'&amp;failover='failover_exchange'
      </pre><p>
	This property can take three values:
      </p><div class="variablelist"><p class="title"><strong>Fail-over Modes</strong></p><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">failover_exchange</span></dt><dd><p>
	      If the connection fails, fail over to any other broker in the cluster.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">roundrobin</span></dt><dd><p>
	      If the connection fails, fail over to one of the brokers specified in the <span class="command"><strong>brokerlist</strong></span>.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">singlebroker</span></dt><dd><p>
	      Fail-over is not supported; the connection is to a single broker only.
	    </p></dd></dl></div><p>
	In a Connection URL, heartbeat is set using the <span class="command"><strong>heartbeat</strong></span> property, which is an integer corresponding to the heartbeat period in seconds. For instance, the following line from a JNDI properties file sets the heartbeat time out to 3 seconds:
      </p><pre class="screen">
	connectionfactory.qpidConnectionfactory = amqp://guest:guest@clientid/test?brokerlist='tcp://localhost:5672'&amp;heartbeat='3'

      The <span class="command"><strong>qpid-ha</strong></span> command allows you to check if a broker is primary,
      and to promote a backup to primary.
    </p><p>
      To test if a broker is the primary:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	qpid-ha -b <em class="replaceable"><code>broker-address</code></em> status --expect=primary
      </pre><p>
      This command will return 0 if the broker at <em class="replaceable"><code>broker-address</code></em>
      is the primary, non-0 otherwise.

      <span class="command"><strong>qpid-ha --help</strong></span> gives information on other commands and options available.
      You can also use <span class="command"><strong>qpid-ha</strong></span> to manually examine and promote brokers. This
      can be useful for testing failover scenarios without having to set up a full resource manager,
