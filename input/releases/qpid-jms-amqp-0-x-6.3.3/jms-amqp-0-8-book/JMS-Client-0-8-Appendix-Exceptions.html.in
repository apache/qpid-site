This could mean that the hostname is
              mispelt, or there is name resolution problem.</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMQConnectionFailure</td><td>Connection refused</td><td><p>Indicates that the host included in the Connection URL's <a class="link" href="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL.html#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-Brokerlist">brokerlist</a>, actively refused the connection. This could mean that the
              hostname and/or port number is incorrect, or the Broker may not be
            running.</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMQConnectionFailure</td><td>connect timed out</td><td><p>Indicates that the host included in the Connection URL's <a class="link" href="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL.html#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-Brokerlist">brokerlist</a>, could not be contacted within the <a class="link" href="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL.html#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-ConnectTimeout">connecttimeout</a>. This could mean that the host is shutdown, or a networking
              routing problem means the host is unreachable.</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMQConnectionFailure</td><td>General SSL Problem; PKIX path building failed; unable to find valid certification
            path to requested target</td><td><p>Indicates that the CA that signed the Broker's certificate is not trusted by
              the JVM of the client. If the Broker is using a private-CA (or a self signed
              certificate) check that the client has been properly configured with a truststore. See
                <a class="xref" href="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Connection.html#JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Connection-SSL" title="5.3.3.&#160;SSL">Section&#160;5.3.3, &#8220;SSL&#8221;</a></p></td></tr><tr><td>AMQConnectionFailure / AMQAuthenticationException</td><td>not allowed</td><td><p>Indicates that the user cannot be authenticated by the Broker.

              virtualhost. The user is recognised by the Broker and is using the correct password
              but does not have permission. This exception normally indicates that the user (or
              group) has not been permissioned within the Broker's <a class="link" href="../../java-broker/book/Java-Broker-Security-ACLs.html" target="_top">Access Control List
                (ACL)</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td>AMQTimeoutException</td><td>The server's response was not received within the time-out period of %d ms.</td><td>
            <p>Indicates that the Broker's response to the request sent by the client was not received
              within a timely fashion. The timeout is governed by
              <a class="link" href="JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties.html#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-SyncOpTimeout">

              </a>.
            </p>
            <p>This can be a symptom of a heavily loaded Broker, an overloaded network or a client JVM itself which
              is too overloaded to process incoming responses. Check for unreasonably long garbage collection pauses.
