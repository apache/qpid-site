      receipt by calling the session's acknowledge method. As in the
      case of sending messages, acknowledged transfer of messages to
      receivers provides at-least-once reliability, which means that the
      loss of the connection or a client crash does not result in lost
      messages; durable messages are not lost even if the broker is
      restarted.

      Some cases may not require this however and the reliability can be
      controlled through a link property in the address options (see
      <a class="xref" href="section-addresses.html#table-link-properties" title="Table&#160;2.3.&#160;Link Properties">Table&#160;2.3, &#8220;Link Properties&#8221;</a>).</p><p>The acknowledge call acknowledges all messages received on
      the session (i.e. all message that have been returned from a fetch
      call on a receiver created on that session).</p><p>The acknowledge call also support an optional parameter
      controlling whether the call is synchronous or not. A synchronous
      acknowledge will block until the server has confirmed that it has
      received the acknowledgement. In the asynchronous case, when the
      call returns there is not yet any guarantee that the server has
      received and processed the acknowledgement. The session may be
      queried for the number of unsettled acknowledgements; when that
      count is zero all acknowledgements made for received messages have
      been successful.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="prefetch.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="40%">2.6.&#160;Receiver Capacity (Prefetch)&#160;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td align="right" valign="top" width="40%">&#160;2.8.&#160;Receiving Messages from Multiple Sources</td></tr></table></div></div>
