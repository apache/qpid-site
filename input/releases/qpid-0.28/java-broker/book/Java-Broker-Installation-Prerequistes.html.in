        The Java Broker is an 100% Java implementation and as such it can be used on any operating
        system supporting Java 1.6 or higher. This includes Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows XP/Vista/7/8.</p><p>
        The broker has been tested with Java implementations from both Oracle and IBM.  Whatever
        platform you chose, it is recommended that you ensure it is patched with any critical updates made
        available from the vendor.

        Verify that your JVM is installed properly by following <a class="link" href="Java-Broker-Miscellaneous.html#Java-Broker-Miscellaneous-JVM-Verification" title="15.1.&#160;JVM Installation verification">these instructions.</a>
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-Disk"></a>2.2.2.&#160;Disk</h3></div></div></div><p>The Java Broker installation requires approximately 20MB of free disk space.</p><p>The Java Broker also requires a working directory.  The working directory is used for
        the message store, that is, the area of the file-system used to record persistent messages whilst they
        are passing through the Broker.  The working directory is also used for the default location of the log file.
        The size of the working directory will depend on the how the Broker is used.</p><p>The performance of the file system hosting the work directory is key to the performance of Broker as
        a whole.  For best performance, choose a device that has low latency and one that is uncontended by other
        applications.</p><p>Be aware that there are additional considerations if you are considering hosting the working directory on NFS. See
        <a class="xref" href="Java-Broker-Stores.html" title="Chapter&#160;10.&#160;Virtual Host Message Stores">Chapter&#160;10, <em>Virtual Host Message Stores</em></a> for further details.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-Memory"></a>2.2.3.&#160;Memory</h3></div></div></div><p>Qpid caches messages on the heap for performance reasons, so in general, the Broker will
        benefit from as much heap as possible. However, on a 32bit JVM, the maximum addressable memory range
        for a process is 4GB, after leaving space for the JVM's own use this will give a maximum heap size
        of approximately ~3.7GB.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-OperatingSystemAccount"></a>2.2.4.&#160;Operating System Account</h3></div></div></div><p>Installation or operation of Qpid does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> require a privileged account (i.e. root
      on UNIX platforms or Administrator on Windows).  However it is suggested that you use an dedicated account
      (e.g. qpid) for the installation and operation of the Java Broker.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="Java-Broker-Installation.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="u" href="Java-Broker-Installation.html">Up</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="Java-Broker-Installation-Download.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="40%">Chapter&#160;2.&#160;Installation&#160;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td align="right" valign="top" width="40%">&#160;2.3.&#160;Download</td></tr></table></div></div>
