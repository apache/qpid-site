   client is using a transacted session and rolls-back the transaction) can be made available on
   the queue again and then subsequently be redelivered, depending on the precise session
   acknowledgement mode and messaging model used by the application. This is normally desirable
   behaviour that contributes to the ability of a system to withstand unexpected errors. However, it
   leaves open the possibility for a message to be repeatedly redelivered (potentially indefinitely),
   consuming system resources and preventing the delivery of other messages. Such undeliverable
   messages are sometimes known as poison messages.</p><p>For an example, consider a stock ticker application that has been designed to consume prices
   contained within JMS TextMessages. What if inadvertently a BytesMessage is placed onto the queue?
   As the ticker application does not expect the BytesMessage, its processing might fail and cause it
   to roll-back the transaction, however the default behavior of the Broker would mean that the
   BytesMessage would be delivered over and over again, preventing the delivery of other legitimate
   messages, until an operator intervenes and removes the erroneous message from the queue. </p><p>Qpid has maximum delivery count and dead-letter queue (DLQ) features which can be used in
   concert to construct a system that automatically handles such a condition. These features are
   described in the following sections.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Runtime-Handling-Undeliverable-Messages-Maximum-Delivery-Count"></a>9.4.2.&#160;Maximum Delivery Count</h3></div></div></div><p> Maximum delivery count is an attribute of a queue. If a consumer application is unable to
   process a message more than the specified number of times, then the Broker will either route the
   message via the queue's <span class="emphasis"><em>alternate binding</em></span> (if one has been defined), or will
   discard the message.</p><p>When using AMQP 1.0 the current delivery count of a message is available to the consuming
   application via the<code class="literal">message-count</code> message header (exposed via the
   <code class="literal">JMSXDeliveryCount</code> JMS message property when using JMS).  When using the
   AMQP 0-8..0-10 protocols this information is not available.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p> When using AMQP 0-8..0-10, in order for a maximum delivery count to be enforced, the consuming application
    <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> call <a class="link" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/jms/Session.html#rollback()" target="_top">Session#rollback()</a> (or <a class="link" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/jms/Session.html#recover()" target="_top">Session#recover()</a> if the session is not transacted). It is during the Broker's
    processing of Session#rollback() (or Session#recover()) that if a message has been seen
    at least the maximum number of times then it will move the message to the DLQ or discard the
    message. If the consuming application fails in another manner, for instance, closes the connection, the
    message will not be re-routed and consumer application will see the same poison message again
    once it reconnects.</p><p> If the consuming application is using Qpid JMS Client 0-x and using AMQP 0-8, 0-9, or 0-9-1
    protocols, it is necessary to set the client system property <code class="varname">qpid.reject.behaviour</code> or
    connection or binding URL option <code class="varname">rejectbehaviour</code> to the value <code class="literal">server</code>.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Runtime-Handling-Undeliverable-Messages-Dead-Letter-Queues"></a>9.4.3.&#160;Alternate Binding</h3></div></div></div><p>Once the maximum delivery count is exceeded, if the queue has an <code class="literal">alternateBinding</code>
    specified, the Broker automatically routes the message via the alternate binding.  The alternate binding
    would normally specify a queue designated for that purpose of receiving the undeliverable messages.
    By convention such queues are known as dead-letter queues or simply DLQs.</p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Avoid excessive queue depth</h3><p>Applications making use of DLQs <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> make provision for the frequent
    examination of messages arriving on DLQs so that both corrective actions can be taken to resolve
    the underlying cause and organise for their timely removal from the DLQ. Messages on DLQs
    consume system resources in the same manner as messages on normal queues so excessive queue
    depths should not be permitted to develop.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="Java-Broker-Runtime-Producer-Transaction-Timeout.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="u" href="Java-Broker-Runtime.html">Up</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="Java-Broker-Runtime-Close-Connection-When-No-Route.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="40%">9.3.&#160;Producer Transaction Timeout&#160;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="Apache-Qpid-Broker-J-Book.html">Home</a></td><td align="right" valign="top" width="40%">&#160;9.5.&#160;Closing client connections on unroutable mandatory messages</td></tr></table></div></div>
