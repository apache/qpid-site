      belonging to a group. This allows a message producer to indicate to the consumer that a group
      of messages should be considered a single logical operation with respect to the application. </p><p> The broker can use this group identification to enforce policies controlling how messages
      from a given group can be distributed to consumers. For instance, the broker can be configured
      to guarantee all the messages from a particular group are processed in order across multiple
      consumers. </p><p> For example, assume we have a shopping application that manages items in a virtual
      shopping cart. A user may add an item to their shopping cart, then change their mind and
      remove it. If the application sends an <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span> message to the broker,
      immediately followed by a <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span> message, they will be queued in the
      proper order - <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span>, followed by <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span>. </p><p> However, if there are multiple consumers, it is possible that once a consumer acquires
      the <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span> message, a different consumer may acquire the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span> message. This allows both messages to be processed in parallel,
      which could result in a "race" where the <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span> operation is incorrectly
      performed before the <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span> operation. </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Concepts-Queues-GroupingMessages"></a>4.7.3.1.&#160;Grouping Messages</h4></div></div></div><p> In order to group messages, the application would designate a particular message header
        as containing a message's <span class="emphasis"><em>group identifier</em></span>. The group identifier stored
        in that header field would be a string value set by the message producer. Messages from the
        same group would have the same group identifier value. The key that identifies the header
        must also be known to the message consumers. This allows the consumers to determine a
        message's assigned group. </p><p> The header that is used to hold the group identifier, as well as the values used as
        group identifiers, are totally under control of the application. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Concepts-Queues-BrokerRole"></a>4.7.3.2.&#160; The Role of the Broker in Message Grouping </h4></div></div></div><p> The broker will apply the following processing on each grouped message: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Enqueue a received message on the destination queue.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Determine the message's group by examining the message's group identifier

                  of that consumer, and the broker will pass all subsequent messages in the group to
                  that consumer. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In 'shared groups' mode (which gives the same behaviour as the Qpid C++
                  Broker) the broker enforces a looser guarantee, namely that all the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>currently unacknowledged messages</em></span> in a group are sent to
                  the same consumer, but the consumer used may change over time even if the
                  consumers do not. This means that only one consumer can be processing messages
                  from a particular group at any given time, however if the consumer acknowledges
                  all of its acquired messages then the broker <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> pass the
                  next pending message in that group to a different consumer. </p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p> The absence of a value in the designated group header field of a message is treated as
        follows: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p> In default mode, failure for a message to specify a group is treated as a desire
              for the message not to be grouped at all. Such messages will be distributed to any
              available consumer, without the ordering quarantees imposed by grouping. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> In 'shared groups' mode (which gives the same behaviour as the Qpid C++ Broker)
              the broker assigns messages without a group value to a 'default group'. Therefore, all
              such "unidentified" messages are considered by the broker as part of the same group,
              which will handled like any other group. The name of this default group is
              "qpid.no-group", although it can be customised as detailed below. </p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p> Note that message grouping has no effect on queue browsers.</p><p> Note well that distinct message groups would not block each other from delivery. For
        example, assume a queue contains messages from two different message groups - say group "A"
        and group "B" - and they are enqueued such that "A"'s messages are in front of "B". If the
        first message of group "A" is in the process of being consumed by a client, then the
        remaining "A" messages are blocked, but the messages of the "B" group are available for
        consumption by other consumers - even though it is "behind" group "A" in the queue. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Concepts-Queues-SetLowPrefetch"></a>4.7.4.&#160;Using low pre-fetch with special queue types</h3></div></div></div><p>Qpid clients receive buffered messages in batches, sized according to the pre-fetch value.
      The current default is 500. </p><p>However, if you use the default value you will probably <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> see
      desirable behaviour when using priority, sorted, lvq or grouped queues. Once the broker has
      sent a message to the client its delivery order is then fixed, regardless of the special
      behaviour of the queue. </p><p>For example, if using a priority queue and a prefetch of 100, and 100 messages arrive with
      priority 2, the broker will send these messages to the client. If then a new message arrives
      with priority 1, the broker cannot leap frog messages of lower priority. The priority 1 will
      be delivered at the front of the next batch of messages to be sent to the client.</p><p> So, you need to set the prefetch values for your client (consumer) to make this sensible.
      To do this set the Java system property <code class="varname">max_prefetch</code> on the client
      environment (using -D) before creating your consumer. </p><p>A default for all client connections can be set via a system property: </p><pre class="programlisting">
-Dmax_prefetch=1
</pre><p> The prefetch can be also be adjusted on a per connection basis by adding a
        <code class="varname">maxprefetch</code> value to the <a class="link" href="../../jms-client-0-8/book/JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL.html" target="_top">Connection URLs</a>
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
amqp://guest:guest@client1/development?maxprefetch='1'&amp;brokerlist='tcp://localhost:5672'
</pre><p>Setting the Qpid pre-fetch to 1 will give exact queue-type semantics as perceived by the
      client however, this brings a performance cost. You could test with a slightly higher
      pre-fetch to trade-off between throughput and exact semantics.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-Concepts-Queue-EnsureNonDestructiveConsumers"></a>4.7.5.&#160;Forcing all consumers to be non-destructive</h3></div></div></div><p>When a consumer attaches to a queue, the normal behaviour is that messages are
          sent to that consumer are acquired exclusively by that consumer, and when the consumer
          acknowledges them, the messages are removed from the queue.</p><p>Another common pattern is to have queue "browsers" which send all messages to the
          browser, but do not prevent other consumers from receiving the messages, and do not
          remove them from the queue when the browser is done with them.  Such a browser is an
          instance of a "non-destructive" consumer.</p><p>If every consumer on a queue is non destructive then we can obtain some interesting
          behaviours. In the case of a LVQ
           then the queue will always contain the most up to date value for every key. For
          a standard queue, if every consumer is non-destructive then we have something that
          behaves like a topic (every consumer receives every message) except that instead of
          only seeing messages that arrive after the point at which the consumer is created, all
          messages which have not been removed due to TTL expiry (or, in the case of LVQs,
          overwirtten by newer values for the same key).</p><p>A queue can be created to enforce all consumers are non-destructive. This can be
          be achieved using the following queue declare argument:</p><div class="table"><a id="d0e1116"></a><p class="title"><strong>Table&#160;4.2.&#160;</strong></p><div class="table-contents"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Argument Name</th><th>Argument Type</th><th>Argument Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>qpid.ensure_nondestructive_consumers</td><td>java.lang.Boolean</td><td>Set to true if the queue should make all consumers attached to it behave

            messages would never get deleted, leaving the queue to grow unconstrainedly. To
            prevent this you can use the ability to set the maximum TTL of the queue. To ensure
            all messages have the same TTL you could also set the minimum TTL to the same value.
        </p><p>Minimum/Maximum TTL for a queue can be set though the HTTP Management UI, using the

            due to TTL. It may be the case that a consumer only wishes to receive messages
            that have been sent in the last 60 minutes, and any new messages that arrive, or
            alternatively it may wish only to receive newly arriving messages and not any that
            are already in the queue. This can be achieved by using a filter on the arrival
            time.</p><p>A special parameter <code class="varname">x-qpid-replay-period</code> can be used in the

            value of <code class="varname">x-qpid-replay-period</code> is the time, in seconds, for which
            the consumer wishes to see messages. A replay period of 0 indicates only newly
            arriving messages should be sent. A replay period of 3600 indicates that only

            see only newly arriving messages (i.e. standard topic-like behaviour) but other consumers
            may wish to start their message stream from some point in the past. This can be achieved by
            setting a default filter on the queue so that consumers which do not explicitly set a replay
            period get a default (in this case the desired default would be 0).</p><p>The default filter set for a queue can be set via the REST API using the attribute named
