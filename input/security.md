## Reporting new security problems with Apache Qpid

We take a very active stance in eliminating security problems and
denial of service attacks against Apache Qpid.

We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to the private
security mailing list of the ASF Security Team, before disclosing them
in a public forum.

Please see the page of the [ASF Security
Team](https://www.apache.org/security/) for further information and
contact information.

The ASF Security Team cannot accept regular bug reports or other
queries, we ask that you use our [bug reporting
page]({{site_url}}/issues.html) for those.

All mail sent to the ASF Security Team that does not relate to
security problems in Apache software will be ignored.

Questions about:

 - how to configure Qpid securely
 - if a vulnerability applies to your particular application
 - obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
 - availability of patches and/or new releases

should be addressed to the users mailing list. Please see the [mailing
lists page]({{site_url}}/discussion.html) for details of how to
subscribe.
