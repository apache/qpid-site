[mailing lists]({{site_url}}/discussion.html#mailing-lists) or
[report a bug]({{site_url}}/issues.html#report-a-bug).

## Make Qpid work for you

Each new user brings new scenarios and new challenges.  Maybe Qpid
doesn't do something that you need.  Since Qpid is open source, *you
can make Qpid do what you need*.  Write a patch and send it to us.  If
you want guidance, [discuss it with us]({{site_url}}/discussion.html).

## Contribute

 - *Fix bugs* - Reporting bugs is a considerable service to us.
   Sending patches is even better.

 - *Test new releases* - Each new release goes through a long period
   of user testing, and we could use your feedback.  Tell us if it
   works in your environment, for your application.

 - *Write documentation* - Good documentation is as important as good
   code.  If you excel at clear communication, consider focusing your
   talents on our documentation.

 - *Add a language binding* - Qpid's APIs support many languages, but
   if it doesn't support yours, lend your knowledge and develop a new
   binding.

 - *Develop new components* - If you have an idea and a need for a new
   component that speaks AMQP, you can build and host it at Qpid.

 - *Package Qpid for new environments* - Maybe Qpid isn't available
   from the package repository for your OS or language.  We want Qpid
   to be everywhere and just a few clicks away.  We value any
   expertise you have in offering Qpid in new places.

 - *Tell others about Qpid* - We think Qpid is good stuff, and more
   people ought to know about it.  If you use Qpid to do something
   cool, tell others about it in a
   [blog post]({{site_url}}/resources.html#blogs), news article, or your
   project's website.  We really appreciate it.
