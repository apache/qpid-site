# Discussion

Have a question or an idea?  We'd be pleased to talk about it.

## Mailing lists

Mailing lists are the primary means of collaboration at Qpid. Send questions, enquiries about potential bugs, etc to the users list. The dev list is used primarily for issue update notifications.

Subscribe to these lists by sending an email to the *subscribe address* listed, *not* the main list address, and you will receive a verification email. To unsubscribe, send an email to the *unsubscribe* address. *Responses to list postings go back to the list, you must subscribe to receive them.*

| List | Purpose | Subscribe | Unsubscribe | Archives |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| [users@qpid.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-users/) | General discussion | [users-subscribe@qpid.apache.org](mailto:users-subscribe@qpid.apache.org) | [users-unsubscribe@](mailto:users-unsubscribe@qpid.apache.org) | [ASF](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@qpid.apache.org), [ASF2](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-users/) |
| [dev@qpid.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-dev/) | Issue notifications | [dev-subscribe@qpid.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@qpid.apache.org) | [dev-unsubscribe@](mailto:dev-unsubscribe@qpid.apache.org) | [ASF](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@qpid.apache.org), [ASF2](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-dev/) |


Qpid also offers lists for
[commits]({{site_url}}/source-code.html#commits-list) and
[notifications]({{site_url}}/source-code.html#notifications-list).

**NOTE**: The Qpid project offers various components in many different
languages. When mailing the lists, please be specific about which
components (or even which part of them) and which versions that you are
using. For example, "I'm using the Qpid Broker-J
&lt;version&gt; with the Qpid JMS &lt;version&gt; AMQP 1.0 client"
rather than "I'm using the broker and JMS client".
