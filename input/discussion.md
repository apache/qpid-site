# Discussion

Have a question or an idea?  We'd be pleased to talk about it.

## Mailing lists

Mailing lists are the primary means of collaboration at Qpid.

in the subject to the subscribe address.  To unsubscribe, it's the
reverse: send an email with "unsubscribe" in the subject to the
unsubscribe address.

Qpid also offers lists for
[commits]({{site_url}}/source-code.html#commits-list) and
[notifications]({{site_url}}/source-code.html#notifications-list).

`NOTE`: The Qpid project offers various components in many different languages. When mailing the lists please be specific about which component, or even which part of a given component, that you are using to better facilitate discussion. For example, "I'm using the Qpid Java &lt;version&gt; broker with the Qpid JMS &lt;version&gt; AMQP 1.0 client" rather than "I'm using the broker and JMS client".
