Have a question or an idea?  We'd be pleased to talk about it.

Qpid also offers lists for
[commits]({{site_url}}/source-code.html#commits-list) and
[notifications]({{site_url}}/source-code.html#notifications-list).

Archives for the retired proton@ list are also available ([ASF](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-proton/), [Nabble](http://qpid.2158936.n2.nabble.com/Apache-Qpid-Proton-f7580687.html)) for historic reference. Going forward, use the users list for discussion of Proton.

**NOTE**: The Qpid project offers various components in many different
languages. When mailing the lists, please be specific about which
components (or even which part of them) and which versions that you are
using. For example, "I'm using the Qpid Broker-J
&lt;version&gt; with the Qpid JMS &lt;version&gt; AMQP 1.0 client"
rather than "I'm using the broker and JMS client".
