# CVE-2016-4432

## Severity

Important

## Affected components

Qpid Broker-J

## Affected versions

6.0.2 and earlier

## Fixed versions

6.0.3

## Description

The code responsible for handling incoming AMQP 0-8, 0-9, 0-91, and
0-10 connections contains a flaw that allows authentication to be
bypassed.  An remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
perform actions, without the need to specify valid credentials.  For
instance, unauthorised messages could be injected or messages stolen.

The vulnerability cannot be exploited if the Access Control List (ACL)
feature is enabled AND access to all virtual hosts controlled.

The vulnerability does not apply to the Broker's AMQP 1.0 support.

The vulnerability does not apply if the Broker is configured to
require SSL client authentication for all messaging connections.

## Resolution

Users should upgrade the Apache Qpid Broker-J to
version 6.0.3 or later (recommended).

## Mitigation

If upgrading is not possible, the vulnerability can be mitigated using
an ACL file containing "ACCESS VIRTUALHOST" clauses that white-lists
user access to all virtualhosts.

If AMQP 0-8, 0-9, 0-91, and 0-10 support is not required, the
vulnerability can also be mitigated by turning off these protocols at
the Port level.
