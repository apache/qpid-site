# CVE-2016-3094

## Severity

Important

## Affected components

Broker-J

## Affected versions

6.0.0, 6.0.1, and 6.0.2

## Fixed versions

6.0.3

## Description

Denial of Service.

A malformed authentication attempt may cause the broker to terminate.
The Apache Qpid Broker-J supports a number of configurable
authentication providers each supporting various SASL mechanisms. Some
mechanisms need (or can be configured to accept) plain-text passwords
being sent to the Broker (using the SASL "PLAIN" mechanism).  Where
the broker has been configured to allow plain-text passwords for
authentication it is possible for a client to send a malformed
authentication attempt which will lead the broker to terminate due to
an uncaught Exception.

Brokers configured to use authentication from the "PlainPasswordFile",
"SimpleLDAP", or "Base64MD5PasswordFile" providers are vulnerable if
the "PLAIN" mechanism is enabled (by default "PLAIN" will be disabled
on non-TLS ports, but enabled on TLS connections).

## Mitigation

Users should upgrade their Apache Qpid Broker-J to
version 6.0.3 or later.  If this is not possible, users can disable
the PLAIN mechanism for their authentication manager on versions 0.32
and later by adding "PLAIN" to the list of disabledMechanisms on their
authentication provider object.

Note that the SimpleLDAP authentication provider requires PLAIN and so
this work around does not apply there.
