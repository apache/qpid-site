# CVE-2017-15699: Apache Qpid Dispatch Denial of Service Vulnerability when specially crafted frame is sent to the Router

## Severity

Important

## Affected components

Qpid Dispatch Router

## Affected versions

0.7.0, 0.8.0

## Fixed versions

0.8.1, 1.0.0

## Description

A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in Apache Qpid Dispatch Router 0.7.0 and 0.8.0. To exploit this vulnerability, a remote user must be able to establish an AMQP connection to the Qpid Dispatch Router and send a specifically crafted AMQP frame which will cause it to segfault and shut down.


## Resolution
Users of Qpid Dispatch Router version 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 must upgrade to version 0.8.1 or later.


## Mitigation
Any user who is able to connect to the Router may exploit the vulnerability. If anonymous authentication is enabled then any remote user with network access the Router is a possible attacker. The number of possible attackers is reduced if the Router is configured to require authentication. Then an attacker needs to have authentic credentials which are used to create a connection to the Router before proceeding to exploit this vulnerability.
