# CVE-2016-8741

## Severity

Moderate

## Affected components

Qpid Broker-J

## Affected versions

6.0.1, 6.0.2, 6.0.3, 6.0.4, 6.0.5, and 6.1.0

## Fixed versions

6.0.6, 6.1.1

## Description

Information Leakage.

The Qpid Broker-J can be configured to use different so called
AuthenticationProviders to handle user authentication.  Among the
choices are the SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 AuthenticationProvider
types.

It was discovered that these AuthenticationProviders prematurely
terminate the SCRAM SASL negotiation if the provided user name does
not exist thus allowing remote attacker to determine the existence of
user accounts.

The Vulnerability does not apply to AuthenticationProviders other than
SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256.

## Mitigation

Users should upgrade the Qpid Broker-J to version 6.0.6,
6.1.1, or later (recommended).

If upgrading is not possible, the vulnerability can be mitigated by
using an AuthenticationProvider other than SCRAM-SHA-1 and
SCRAM-SHA-256.
