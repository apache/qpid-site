# CVE-2018-8030: Apache Qpid Broker-J Denial of Service Vulnerability when AMQP 0-8...0-91 messages exceed maximum size limit

## Severity

Important

## Affected components

Qpid Broker-J

## Affected versions

7.0.0, 7.0.1, 7.0.2, 7.0.3 and 7.0.4

## Fixed versions

7.0.5

## Description

A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in Apache Qpid Broker-J
versions 7.0.0-7.0.4 when AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9 or 0-91 are used to
publish messages with size greater than allowed maximum message size limit
(100MB by default). The broker crashes due to the defect. AMQP protocols
0-10 and 1.0 are not affected.

## Resolution

Users of Broker-J versions 7.0.0-7.0.4 utilizing AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9 or 0-91
for message publishing must upgrade to version 7.0.5 or later.

## Mitigation

If upgrade of the broker is not possible, the maximum message size limit can be
disabled by setting context variable "qpid.max\_message\_size" to "0" or
any negative value. The change can be made either directly in the broker
configuration file, or by using management interfaces (for example, REST API)
or by sing JVM option -Dqpid.max\_message\_size=0. A broker restart is required
for the change to take effect.
Alternatively, the support for AMQP protocols 0-8...0-91 can be
removed on AMQP ports.
The change can be made either directly in the broker configuration file
or by using management interfaces. An example of REST API call
restricting AMQP port to support only to AMQP 1.0 and AMQP 0-10 using curl
utility is provided below:

```sh
curl --user <user-name> -X POST  -d '{"protocols":["AMQP_1_0","AMQP_0_10"]}' https://<broker host>:<broker port>/api/latest/port/<port name>
```
