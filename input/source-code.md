# Source Code

Qpid employs
[revision control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) to
track and manage changes to its source code.


## Browse the code

The [Dashboard]({{site_url}}/dashboard.html) page provides links to the
repository for each individual component. The repositories are all directly
viewable, and GitHub mirrors are additionally provided for each.

## Check out the code

To access code from one of the Git repositories, use the `git clone` command
with its URL, e.g for Qpid JMS:

    Qpid JMS
    % git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/qpid-jms.git qpid-jms

Alternatively, you can use the mirror repositories available on GitHub to
create your own fork.

## Install the code

Consult the install documentation below, or see the respective component
documentation for more details.
