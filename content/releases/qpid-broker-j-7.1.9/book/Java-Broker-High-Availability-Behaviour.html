It
      then goes on to talk about the various controls that are available to override it. It
      describes the controls available that affect the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID#Durability" target="_top">durability</a> of transactions and
      the data consistency between the master and replicas and thus make trade offs between
      performance and reliability.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-High-Availability-Behaviour-Default-Behaviour"></a>10.4.1.&#160;Default Behaviour</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's first look at the behaviour of a group in default configuration.</p><p>In the default configuration, for any messaging work to be done, there must be at least
          <span class="emphasis"><em>quorum</em></span> nodes present. This means for example, in a three node group,
        this means there must be at least two nodes available.</p><p>When a messaging client sends a transaction, it can be assured that, before the control
        returns back to his application after the commit call that the following is true:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>At the master, the transaction is <span class="emphasis"><em>written to disk and OS level caches
                are flushed</em></span> meaning the data is on the storage device.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At least quorum minus 1 replicas, <span class="emphasis"><em>acknowledge the receipt of
                transaction</em></span>. The replicas will write the data to the storage device
              sometime later.</p></li></ul></div><p>If there were to be a master failure immediately after the transaction was committed,
        the transaction would be held by at least quorum minus one replicas. For example, if we had
        a group of three, then we would be assured that at least one replica held the
        transaction.</p><p>In the event of a master failure, if quorum nodes remain, those nodes hold an election.
        The nodes will elect master the node with the most recent transaction. If two or more nodes
        have the most recent transaction the group makes an arbitrary choice. If quorum number of
        nodes does not remain, the nodes cannot elect a new master and will wait until nodes rejoin.
        You will see later that manual controls are available allow service to be restored from
        fewer than quorum nodes and to influence which node gets elected in the event of a
        tie.</p><p>Whenever a group has fewer than quorum nodes present, the virtualhost will be
        unavailable and messaging connections will be refused. If quorum disappears at the very
        moment a messaging client sends a transaction that transaction will fail.</p><p>You will have noticed the difference in the synchronization policies applied the master
        and the replicas. The replicas send the acknowledgement back before the data is written to
        disk. The master synchronously writes the transaction to storage. This is an example of a
        trade off between durability and performance. We will see more about how to control this
        trade off later.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-High-Availability-Behaviour-SynchronizationPolicy"></a>10.4.2.&#160;Synchronization Policy</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>synchronization policy</em></span> dictates what a node must do when it
        receives a transaction before it acknowledges that transaction to the rest of the
        group.</p><p>The following options are available: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>SYNC</em></span>. The node must write the transaction to disk and flush
              any OS level buffers before sending the acknowledgement. SYNC is offers the highest
              durability but offers the least performance.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>WRITE_NO_SYNC</em></span>. The node must write the transaction to disk
              before sending the acknowledgement. OS level buffers will be flush as some point
              later. This typically provides an assurance against failure of the application but not
              the operating system or hardware.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>NO_SYNC</em></span>. The node immediately sends the acknowledgement. The
              transaction will be written and OS level buffers flushed as some point later. NO_SYNC
              offers the highest performance but the lowest durability level. This synchronization
              policy is sometimes known as <span class="emphasis"><em>commit to the network</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is possible to assign a one policy to the master and a different policy to the
        replicas. These are configured as <a class="link" href="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Virtualhosts.html#Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Virtualhost-Attributes" title="7.4.3.&#160;Attributes">attributes on the
          virtualhost</a>. By default the master uses <span class="emphasis"><em>SYNC</em></span> and replicas use
          <span class="emphasis"><em>NO_SYNC</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-High-Availability-Behaviour-NodePriority"></a>10.4.3.&#160;Node Priority</h3></div></div></div><p>Node priority can be used to influence the behaviour of the election algorithm. It is
        useful in the case were you want to favour some nodes over others. For instance, if you wish
        to favour nodes located in a particular data centre over those in a remote site. </p><p>The following options are available: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Highest</em></span>. Nodes with this priority will be more favoured. In
              the event of two or more nodes having the most recent transaction, the node with this
              priority will be elected master. If two or more nodes have this priority the algorithm
              will make an arbitrary choice.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>High</em></span>. Nodes with this priority will be favoured but not as
              much so as those with Highest.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Normal</em></span>. This is default election priority.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Never</em></span>. The node will never be elected <span class="emphasis"><em>even if the
                node has the most recent transaction</em></span>. The node will still keep up to date
              with the replication stream and will still vote itself, but can just never be
              elected.</p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>Node priority is configured as an <a class="link" href="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Virtualhost-Nodes.html#Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Virtualhost-Nodes-Attributes" title="7.3.2.&#160;Attributes">attribute on the
          virtualhost node</a> and can be changed at runtime and is effective immediately.</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>Use of the Never priority can lead to transaction loss. For example, consider a group
          of three where replica-2 is marked as Never. If a transaction were to arrive and it be
          acknowledged only by Master and Replica-2, the transaction would succeed. Replica 1 is
          running behind for some reason (perhaps a full-GC). If a Master failure were to occur at
          that moment, the replicas would elect Replica-1 even though Replica-2 had the most recent
          transaction.</p><p>Transaction loss is reported by message <a class="link" href="Java-Broker-Appendix-Operation-Logging.html#Java-Broker-Appendix-Operation-Logging-Message-HA-1014">HA-1014</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-High-Availability-Behaviour-MinimumNumberOfNodes"></a>10.4.4.&#160;Required Minimum Number Of Nodes</h3></div></div></div><p>This controls the required minimum number of nodes to complete a transaction and to
        elect a new master. By default, the required number of nodes is set to
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Default</em></span> (which signifies quorum).</p><p>It is possible to reduce the required minimum number of nodes. The rationale for doing
        this is normally to temporarily restore service from fewer than quorum nodes following an
        extraordinary failure.</p><p>For example, consider a group of three. If one node were to fail, as quorum still
        remained, the system would continue work without any intervention. If the failing node were
        the master, a new master would be elected.</p><p>What if a further node were to fail? Quorum no longer remains, and the remaining node
        would just wait. It cannot elect itself master. What if we wanted to restore service from
        just this one node?</p><p>In this case, Required Number of Nodes can be reduced to 1 on the remain node, allowing
        the node to elect itself and service to be restored from the singleton. Required minimum
        number of nodes is configured as an <a class="link" href="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Virtualhost-Nodes.html#Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Virtualhost-Nodes-Attributes" title="7.3.2.&#160;Attributes">attribute on the
          virtualhost node</a> and can be changed at runtime and is effective immediately.</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>The attribute must be used cautiously. Careless use will lead to lost transactions and
          can lead to a <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain_(computing)" target="_top">split-brain</a> in the event of a network partition. If used to temporarily restore
          service from fewer than quorum nodes, it is <span class="emphasis"><em>imperative</em></span> to revert it
          to the Default value as the failed nodes are restored.</p><p>Transaction loss is reported by message <a class="link" href="Java-Broker-Appendix-Operation-Logging.html#Java-Broker-Appendix-Operation-Logging-Message-HA-1014">HA-1014</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-High-Availability-Behaviour-DesignatedPrimary"></a>10.4.5.&#160;Allow to Operate Solo</h3></div></div></div><p>This attribute only applies to groups containing exactly two nodes.</p><p> In a group of two, if a node were to fail then in default configuration work will cease
        as quorum no longer exists. A single node cannot elect itself master. </p><p>The <code class="literal">allow to operate solo</code> flag allows a node in a two node group to elect itself master and
        to operate sole. It is configured as an <a class="link" href="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Virtualhost-Nodes.html#Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Virtualhost-Nodes-Attributes" title="7.3.2.&#160;Attributes">attribute on the
          virtualhost node</a> and can be changed at runtime and is effective immediately.</p><p>For example, consider a group of two where the master fails. Service will be interrupted
        as the remaining node cannot elect itself master. To allow it to become master, apply the
        <code class="literal">allow to operate solo</code> flag to it. It will elect itself master and work can continue, albeit
        from one node.</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>It is imperative not to allow the <code class="literal">allow to operate solo</code> flag to be set on both nodes at once. To
          do so will mean, in the event of a network partition, a <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain_(computing)" target="_top">split-brain</a> will
            occur.</p><p>Transaction loss is reported by message <a class="link" href="Java-Broker-Appendix-Operation-Logging.html#Java-Broker-Appendix-Operation-Logging-Message-HA-1014">HA-1014</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Java-Broker-High-Availability-Behaviour-MaximumMessageSize"></a>10.4.6.&#160;Maximum message size</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Internally, BDB JE HA restricts the maximum size of replication stream records passed from the master
        to the replica(s). This helps prevent DOS attacks.
        If expected application maximum message size is greater than 5MB, the BDB JE setting
        <code class="literal">je.rep.maxMessageSize</code> and Qpid context variable <code class="literal">qpid.max_message_size</code>
        needs to be adjusted to reflect this in order to avoid running into the BDB HA JE limit.
