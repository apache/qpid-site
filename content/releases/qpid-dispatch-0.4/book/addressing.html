<h1>3.2. Addressing<a class="headerlink" href="#addressing" title="Permalink to this headline">.</a></h1>
<p>AMQP addresses are used to control the flow of messages across a network
of routers. Addresses are used in a number of different places in the
AMQP 1.0 protocol. They can be used in a specific message in the <cite>to</cite>
and <cite>reply-to</cite> fields of a message&#8217;s properties. They are also used
during the creation of links in the <cite>address</cite> field of a <cite>source</cite> or
a <cite>target</cite>.</p>
<p>Addresses designate various kinds of entities in a messaging network:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Endpoint processes that consume data or offer a service</li>
<li>Topics that match multiple consumers to multiple producers</li>
<li>Entities within a messaging broker:
-  Queues
-  Durable Topics
-  Exchanges</li>
</ul>
<p>The syntax of an AMQP address is opaque as far as the router network is
concerned. A syntactical structure may be used by the administrator that
creates addresses, but the router treats them as opaque strings. Routers
consider addresses to be mobile such that any address may be directly
connected to any router in a network and may move around the topology.
In cases where messages are broadcast to or balanced across multiple
consumers, an address may be connected to multiple routers in the
network.</p>
<p>Addresses have semantics associated with them. When an address is
created in the network, it is assigned a set of semantics (and access
rules) during a process called provisioning. The semantics of an address
control how routers behave when they see the address being used.</p>
<p>Address semantics include the following considerations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Routing pattern</em> - direct, multicast, balanced</li>
<li><em>Undeliverable action</em> - drop, hold and retry, redirect</li>
<li><em>Reliability</em> - N destinations, etc.</li>
</ul>

address. In this case, messages are routed to exactly one of the
consumers, and the network attempts to balance the traffic load across
the set of consumers using the same address.</td>

<h2>3.2.2. Routing mechanisms<a class="headerlink" href="#routing-mechanisms" title="Permalink to this headline">.</a></h2>
<p>The fact that addresses can be used in different ways suggests that
message routing can be accomplished in different ways. Before going into
the specifics of the different routing mechanisms, it would be good to
first define what is meant by the term <em>routing</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>In a network built of multiple routers connected by connections
(i.e., nodes and edges in a graph), <em>routing</em> determines which
connection to use to send a message directly to its destination or
one step closer to its destination.</div></blockquote>
<p>Each router serves as the terminus of a collection of incoming and
outgoing links. The links either connect directly to endpoints that
produce and consume messages, or they connect to other routers in the
network along previously established connections.</p>
<div class="section" id="message-routing">
<h3>3.2.2.1. Message routing<a class="headerlink" href="#message-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">.</a></h3>
<p>Message routing occurs upon delivery of a message and is done based on
the address in the message&#8217;s <cite>to</cite> field.</p>
<p>When a delivery arrives on an incoming link, the router extracts the
address from the delivered message&#8217;s <cite>to</cite> field and looks the address
up in its routing table. The lookup results in zero or more outgoing
links onto which the message shall be resent.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="19%" />
<col width="81%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><em>Delivery</em></th>
<th class="head"><em>Handling</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td><em>pre-settled</em></td>
<td>If the arriving delivery is pre-settled (i.e., fire and forget), the
incoming delivery shall be settled by the router, and the outgoing
deliveries shall also be pre-settled. In other words, the pre-settled
nature of the message delivery is propagated across the network to the
message&#8217;s destination.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><em>unsettled</em></td>
<td>Unsettled delivery is also propagated across the network. Because
unsettled delivery records cannot be discarded, the router tracks the
incoming deliveries and keeps the association of the incoming
deliveries to the resulting outgoing deliveries. This kept association
allows the router to continue to propagate changes in delivery state
(settlement and disposition) back and forth along the path which the
message traveled.</td>
