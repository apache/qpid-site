<h1 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Overview</h2>
<p>The Dispatch router is an AMQP message message router that provides advanced interconnect capabilities. It allows flexible routing of messages between any AMQP-enabled endpoints, whether they be clients, servers, brokers or any other entity that can send or receive standard AMQP messages.</p>
<p>A messaging client can make a single AMQP connection into a messaging bus built of Dispatch routers and, over that connection, exchange messages with one or more message brokers, and at the same time exchange messages directly with other endpoints without involving a broker at all.</p>
<p>The router is an intermediary for messages but it is <em>not</em> a broker. It does not <em>take responsibility for</em> messages. It will, however, propagate settlement and disposition across a network such that delivery guarantees are met. In other words: the router network will deliver the message, possibly via several intermediate routers, <em>and</em> it will route the acknowledgement of that message by the ultimate reciever back across the same path. This means that <em>responsibility</em> for the message is transfered from the original sender to the ultimate receiver <em>as if they were directly connected</em>. However this is done via a flexible network that allows highly configurable routing of the message transparent to both sender and receiver.</p>
<p>There are some patterns where this enables &quot;brokerless messaging&quot; approaches that are preferable to brokered approaches. In other cases a broker is essential (in particular where you need the separation of responsibility and/or the buffering provided by store-and-forward) but a dispatch network can still be useful to tie brokers and clients together into patterns that are difficult with a single broker.</p>
<p>For a &quot;brokerless&quot; example, consider the common brokered implementation of the request-response pattern, a client puts a request on a queue and then waits for a reply on another queue. In this case the broker can be a hindrance - the client may want to know immediatly if there is nobody to serve the request, but typically it can only wait for a timeout to discover this. With a dispatch network, the client can be informed immediately if its message cannot be delivered because nobody is listening. When the client receives acknowledgement of the request it knows not just that it is sitting on a queue, but that it has actually been received by the server.</p>
<p>For an exampe of using dispatch to enhance the use of brokers, consider using an array of brokers to implement a scalable distributed work queue. A dispatch network can make this appear as a single queue, with senders publishing to a single address and receivers subscribing to a single address. The dispatch network can distribute work to any broker in the array and collect work from any broker for any receiver. Brokers can be shut down or added without affecting clients. This elegantly solves the common difficult of &quot;stuck messages&quot; when implementing this pattern with brokers alone. If a receiver is connected to a broker that has no messages, but there are messages on another broker, you have to somehow transfer them or leave them &quot;stuck&quot;. With a dispatch network, <em>all</em> the receivers are connected to <em>all</em> the brokers. If there is a message anywhere it can be delivered to any receiver.</p>
<p>The router is meant to be deployed in topologies of multiple routers, preferably with redundant paths. It uses link-state routing protocols and algorithms (similar to OSPF or IS-IS from the networking world) to calculate the best path from every point to every other point and to recover quickly from failures. It does not need to use clustering for high availability; rather, it relies on redundant paths to provide continued connectivity in the face of system or network failure. Because it never takes responsibility for messages it is effectively stateless, messages not delivered to their final destination will not be acknowledged to the sender and therefore the sender can re-send such messages if it is disconnected from the network.</p>
<h2 id="benefits"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simplifies connectivity</li>
<li>An endpoint can do all of its messaging through a single transport connection</li>
<li>Avoid opening holes in firewalls for incoming connections</li>
<li>Simplifies reliability</li>
<li>Reliability and availability are provided using redundant topology, not server clustering</li>
<li>Reliable end-to-end messaging without persistent stores</li>

<h1 id="using-qpid-dispatch"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Using Qpid Dispatch</h1>
<h2 id="configuration"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Configuration</h2>
<p>The default configuration file is installed in <em>install-prefix</em>/etc/qpid/qdrouterd.conf. This configuration file will cause the router to run in standalone mode, listening on the standard AMQP port (5672). Dispatch Router looks for the configuration file in the installed location by default. If you wish to use a different path, the &quot;-c&quot; command line option will instruct Dispatch Router as to which configuration to load.</p>
<p>To run the router, invoke the executable: qdrouterd [-c my-config-file]</p>
<p>For more details of the configuration file see the <code>qdrouterd.conf(5)</code> man page.</p>
<h2 id="client-compatibility"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Client Compatibility</h2>
<p>Dispatch Router should, in theory, work with any client that is compatible with AMQP 1.0. The following clients have been tested:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left"><em>Client</em></th>
<th align="left"><em>Notes</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">qpid::messaging</td>
<td align="left">The Qpid messaging clients work with Dispatch Router as long as they are configured to use the 1.0 version of the protocol. To enable AMQP 1.0 in the C++ client, use the {protocol:amqp1.0} connection option.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Proton Messenger</td>
<td align="left">Messenger works with Dispatch Router.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="tools"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Tools</h2>
<h3 id="qdstat"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> qdstat</h3>
<p><em>qdstat</em> is a command line tool that lets you view the status of a Dispatch Router. The following options are useful for seeing that the router is doing:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left"><em>Option</em></th>
<th align="left"><em>Description</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">-l</td>
<td align="left">Print a list of AMQP links attached to the router. Links are unidirectional. Outgoing links are usually associated with a subscription address. The tool distinguishes between <em>endpoint</em> links and <em>router</em> links. Endpoint links are attached to clients using the router. Router links are attached to other routers in a network of routbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">-a</td>
<td align="left">Print a list of addresses known to the router.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">-n</td>
<td align="left">Print a list of known routers in the network.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">-c</td>
<td align="left">Print a list of connections to the router.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For complete details see the <code>qdstat(8)</code> man page and the output of <code>qdstat --help</code>.</p>
<h3 id="qdmanage"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> qdmanage</h3>
<p><em>qdmanage</em> is a general-purpose AMQP management client that allows you to not only view but modify the configuration of a running dispatch router.</p>
<p>For example you can query all the connection entities in the route r $ qdrouterd query --type connection</p>
<p>To enable logging debug and higher level messages by default: $ qdrouter update log/DEFAULT enable=debug+</p>
<p>In fact, everything that can be configured in the configuration file can also be created in a running router via management. For example to create a new listener in a running router: $ qdrouter create type=listener port=5555</p>
<p>Now you can connect to port 5555, for exampple $ qdrouterd query -b localhost:5555 --type listener</p>
<p>For complete details see the <code>qdmanage(8)</code> man page and the output of <code>qdmanage --help</code>. Also for details of what can be configured see the <code>qdrouterd.conf(5)</code> man page.</p>
<h2 id="features-and-examples"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Features and Examples</h2>
<h3 id="standalone-and-interior-modes"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Standalone and Interior Modes</h3>
<p>The router can operate stand-alone or as a node in a network of routers. The mode is configured in the <em>router</em> section of the configuration file. In stand-alone mode, the router does not attempt to collaborate with any other routers and only routes messages among directly connected endpoints.</p>
<p>If your router is running in stand-alone mode, <em>qdstat -a</em> will look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ qdstat -a
Router Addresses
  class  address      in-proc  local  remote  in  out  thru  to-proc  from-proc
  ===============================================================================
  local  $management  Y        0      0       1   0    0     1        0
  local  temp.AY81ga           1      0       0   0    0     0        0</code></pre>
<p>Note that there are two known addresses. <em>$management</em> is the address of the router's embedded management agent. <em>temp.AY81ga</em> is the temporary reply-to address of the <em>qdstat</em> client making requests to the agent.</p>
<p>If you change the mode to interior and restart the processs, the same command will yield two additional addresses which are used for inter-router communication:</p>
<pre><code>$ qdstat -a
Router Addresses
  class  address      in-proc  local  remote  in  out  thru  to-proc  from-proc
  ===============================================================================
  local  $management  Y        0      0       1   0    0     1        0
  local  qdhello      Y        0      0       0   0    0     0        3
  local  qdrouter     Y        0      0       0   0    0     0        1
  local  temp.khOpGb           1      0       0   0    0     0        0</code></pre>
<h3 id="mobile-subscribers"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Mobile Subscribers</h3>
<p>The term &quot;mobile subscriber&quot; simply refers to the fact that a client may connect to the router and subscribe to an address to receive messages sent to that address. No matter where in the network the subscriber attaches, the messages will be routed to the appropriate destination.</p>
<p>To illustrate a subscription on a stand-alone router, you can use the examples that are provided with Qpid Proton. Using the <em>recv.py</em> example receiver:</p>
<pre><code>$ recv.py amqp://0.0.0.0/my-address</code></pre>
<p>This command creates a receiving link subscribed to the specified address. To verify the subscription:</p>
<pre><code>$ qdstat -a
Router Addresses
  class   address      in-proc  local  remote  in  out  thru  to-proc  from-proc
  ================================================================================
  local   $management  Y        0      0       1   0    0     1        0
  mobile  my-address            1      0       0   0    0     0        0
  local   temp.fDt8_a           1      0       0   0    0     0        0</code></pre>
<p>You can then, in a separate command window, run a sender to produce messages to that address:</p>
<pre><code>$ send.py -a amqp://0.0.0.0/my-address</code></pre>
<h3 id="dynamic-reply-to"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> Dynamic Reply-To</h3>
<p>Dynamic reply-to can be used to obtain a reply-to address that routes back to a client's receiving link regardless of how many hops it has to take to get there. To illustrate this feature, see below a simple program (written in C++ against the qpid::messaging API) that queries the management agent of the attached router for a list of other known routers' management addresses.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;qpid/messaging/Address.h&gt;
#include &lt;qpid/messaging/Connection.h&gt;
#include &lt;qpid/messaging/Message.h&gt;
#include &lt;qpid/messaging/Receiver.h&gt;
#include &lt;qpid/messaging/Sender.h&gt;
#include &lt;qpid/messaging/Session.h&gt;

using namespace qpid::messaging;
using namespace qpid::types;

using std::stringstream;
using std::string;

int main() {
    const char* url = &quot;amqp:tcp:127.0.0.1:5672&quot;;
    std::string connectionOptions = &quot;{protocol:amqp1.0}&quot;;

    Connection connection(url, connectionOptions);
    connection.open();

<h1 id="addressing"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Addressing</h1>
<p>AMQP addresses are used to control the flow of messages across a network of routers. Addresses are used in a number of different places in the AMQP 1.0 protocol. They can be used in a specific message in the <code>to</code> and <code>reply-to</code> fields of a message's properties. They are also used during the creation of links in the <code>address</code> field of a <code>source</code> or a <code>target</code>.</p>
<p>Addresses designate various kinds of entities in a messaging network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endpoint processes that consume data or offer a service</li>
<li>Topics that match multiple consumers to multiple producers</li>
<li>Entities within a messaging broker:</li>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>Durable Topics</li>
<li>Exchanges</li>
</ul>
<p>The syntax of an AMQP address is opaque as far as the router network is concerned. A syntactical structure may be used by the administrator that creates addresses, but the router treats them as opaque strings. Routers consider addresses to be mobile such that any address may be directly connected to any router in a network and may move around the topology. In cases where messages are broadcast to or balanced across multiple consumers, an address may be connected to multiple routers in the network.</p>
<p>Addresses have semantics associated with them. When an address is created in the network, it is assigned a set of semantics (and access rules) during a process called provisioning. The semantics of an address control how routers behave when they see the address being used.</p>
<p>Address semantics include the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Routing pattern</em> - direct, multicast, balanced</li>
<li><em>Undeliverable action</em> - drop, hold and retry, redirect</li>
<li><em>Reliability</em> - N destinations, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="routing-patterns"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Routing patterns</h2>
<p>Routing patterns constrain the paths that a message can take across a network.</p>

<th align="left"><em>Description</em></th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><em>Direct</em></td>
<td align="left">Direct routing allows for only one consumer to use an address at a time. Messages (or links) follow the lowest cost path across the network from the sender to the one receiver.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><em>Multicast</em></td>
<td align="left">Multicast routing allows multiple consumers to use the same address at the same time. Messages are routed such that each consumer receives a copy of the message.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><em>Balanced</em></td>
<td align="left">Balanced routing also allows multiple consumers to use the same address. In this case, messages are routed to exactly one of the consumers, and the network attempts to balance the traffic load across the set of consumers using the same address.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="routing-mechanisms"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Routing mechanisms</h2>
<p>The fact that addresses can be used in different ways suggests that message routing can be accomplished in different ways. Before going into the specifics of the different routing mechanisms, it would be good to first define what is meant by the term <em>routing</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a network built of multiple routers connected by connections (i.e., nodes and edges in a graph), <em>routing</em> determines which connection to use to send a message directly to its destination or one step closer to its destination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each router serves as the terminus of a collection of incoming and outgoing links. The links either connect directly to endpoints that produce and consume messages, or they connect to other routers in the network along previously established connections.</p>
<h3 id="message-routing"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Message routing</h3>
<p>Message routing occurs upon delivery of a message and is done based on the address in the message's <code>to</code> field.</p>
<p>When a delivery arrives on an incoming link, the router extracts the address from the delivered message's <code>to</code> field and looks the address up in its routing table. The lookup results in zero or more outgoing links onto which the message shall be resent.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left"><em>Delivery</em></th>
<th align="left"><em>Handling</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><em>pre-settled</em></td>
<td align="left">If the arriving delivery is pre-settled (i.e., fire and forget), the incoming delivery shall be settled by the router, and the outgoing deliveries shall also be pre-settled. In other words, the pre-settled nature of the message delivery is propagated across the network to the message's destination.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><em>unsettled</em></td>
<td align="left">Unsettled delivery is also propagated across the network. Because unsettled delivery records cannot be discarded, the router tracks the incoming deliveries and keeps the association of the incoming deliveries to the resulting outgoing deliveries. This kept association allows the router to continue to propagate changes in delivery state (settlement and disposition) back and forth along the path which the message traveled.</td>
</tr>

<p>Qpid Dispatch is manageable remotely via AMQP. It is compliant with the emerging AMQP Management specification (draft 9).</p>
<p>Differences from the specification:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;name&quot; attribute is not required when an entity is created. If not supplied it will be set to the same value as the system-generated &quot;identity&quot; attribute. Otherwise it is treated as per the standard.</li>
<li>The REGISTER operation is not implementd. The router has its own mechansm to discover peers that does not require this operation.</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="management-schema"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Management Schema</h1>
<p>This chapter documents the set of <em>management entity types</em> that define configuration and management of a Dispatch Router.</p>
<p>All management entity types have the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>type</em>: The fully qualified type of the entity, e.g. <code>org.apache.qpid.dispatch.router</code>. In this documentation and when using dispatch tools you can use the short name of the type, e.g. <code>router</code></p></li>
<li><p><em>identity</em>: A system-generated identity of the entity. It includes the short type name and some identifying information. E.g. <code>log/AGENT</code> or <code>listener/localhost:amqp</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two kinds of management entity type.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Configuration</em> Entities: Parameters that can be set in the configuration file (see <code>qdrouterd.conf(5)</code> man page) or set at run-time with the <code>qdmanage(8)</code> tool.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Operational</em> Entities: Run-time status values that can be queried using <code>qdstat(8)</code> or <code>qdmanage(8)</code> tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuration-entities"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Configuration Entities</h2>
<p>Configuration entities define the attributes allowed in the configuration file (see <code>qdrouterd.conf(5)</code>) but you can also create entities once the router is running using the <code>qdrouterd(8)</code> tool's <code>create</code> operation. Some entities can also be modified using the <code>update</code> operation, see the entity descriptions below.</p>
